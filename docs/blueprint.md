- Accent color: Blue (#4682B4), an analogous hue providing a cool, calming, sporty complement to the green without overwhelming it.
- Font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif font to create a balance of modernity and approachability across the platform for all text.
- Use simple, modern icons to represent different sports and facility types.
- Maintain a clean and organized layout with clear calls to action to prioritize the user flows for booking and facility management.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and feedback animations for a polished and engaging user experience.
